# How to complete a Kaggle Competition with Machine Learning

In this Facebook Live Coding session, DataCamp's very own Hugo Bowne-Anderson will take you from zero to one with machine learning to make several submissions to Kaggle's (in)famous Titanic machine learning competition. The goal will be to build an algorithm that predicts whether any given passenger on the Titanic survived or not, given data on them such as the fare they paid, where they embarked and their age. You'll do so using the Python programming language, Jupyter notebooks and state-of-the-art packages such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn` and `seaborn`. You'll delve into this rich dataset and, along the way, build your chops in exploratory data analysis, data munging and cleaning, and machine learning. No previous experience with machine learning necessary. Join us for this live, interactive code along.
